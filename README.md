# Ice Cream Inventory

A mont necessary app for your cold delights.

Running at https://ice-cream-inventory.surge.sh/

A Single-Page application for keeping track of your fridge contents. Implements basic CRUD functionality and displays a donut chart for the litre amounts.

### Instructions

- clone or download the repo
- `npm install`

### To-Do

Figure out code splitting, `npm run build` complains about the entry bundle size. Perhaps putting a donut chart on the front page was a bad idea. Also, using https://buefy.org/ just for Table and Toast was overkill, could have used https://bulma.io/ css classes directly.
